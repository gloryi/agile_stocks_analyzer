# agile_stocks_analyzer

A collection of scripts for realtime analysis of selected stock market assets.
With capabilities of system self-learning and recalibration in time on weak perfomance.
With stock market simulator to simulate trading on signals in realtime.
Proof-of concept model.

For now no documentation. A tonns of refactoring required.

Some examples of system in work.

Example of calibrated model's analysis of realtime data. Both to recalibrate and produce signals.
